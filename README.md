BETA v 0.1 

Based on Piteer Explorer this script once enabled will just Move to unexplored points and if monsters are in range it will kill them. 
Requires ORBWALKER clear in order to kill 

can be used to create various other scripts by adding tasks, editing task manager etc. 

I will attempt to support, but as a utility script dont expect much development here.
